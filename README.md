## ⚠️ Important Note About AI Feature

> ⚠️ **SPECIAL NOTICE**  
> The AI design generation feature *might work or might not work* depending on:
> - Whether your OpenAI API key is active and has enough credits  
> - Your subscription tier with OpenAI (DALL·E API access may be limited)  
> - Proper backend configuration with valid CORS and environment setup  
>
> Ensure you’ve followed the setup correctly and have access to DALL·E models. This feature is optional and may require a paid plan.
